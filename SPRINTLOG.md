# Sprint Backlog

## Sprint 1
Committed: S1, S2\n 
Reach Goal: Begin work on S3
User Story S1: As a runner, I want to see cadence calculated from vertical acceleration from logged data (not live)
User Story S2: As a runner, I want to see altitude change from logged data (not live)
User Story S3: As a runner, I want total_power calculated from flat and hill running from logged data (not live) 
Tasks:
- Find all necessary components that I need to order, and order those.
- Apply filter to vertical acceleration
- Write code to find cadence from filtered data
- Calculate altitude changes from filtered data
- Calculate power from flat and vertical climbing
- Log all necessary data points to verify functionality.

Definition of Done: Cadence and altitude pass the DoD as outlined in BACKLOG.md and are partially or fully calculating total_power
accurately as outlined in BACKLOG.md with all functionalities working individually and together. 

## Sprint 2
Commited: S3 and S4
User Story S3: As a runner, I want total_power calculated from flat and hill running (after the fact for now)
User Story S4: As a runner, I want an LED gradient to show my exerted effort.
Tasks:
- Find all necessary components I need to order, and order those.
- Write additional code to translate power to colors
- Connect wirelessly output of microp to LED (somewhere where the LED is easily visible, e.g wrist)
- Log all necessary data points to verify functionality. 
Definition of Done: Cadence and altitude are used to calculate total_power accurately as defined in BACKLOG.md
and LED is working as outlined in BACKLOG.md.
