# Sprint Backlog

## Sprint 1
Committed: S1, S2<br>
Reach Goal: Begin work on S3<br>
User Story S1: As a runner, I want to see cadence calculated from vertical acceleration from logged data (not live)<br>
User Story S2: As a runner, I want to see altitude change from logged data (not live)<br>
User Story S3: As a runner, I want total_power calculated from flat and hill running from logged data (not live)<br>
Tasks:<br>
- Find all necessary components that I need to order, and order those.<br>
- Apply filter to vertical acceleration<br>
- Write code to find cadence from filtered data<br>
- Calculate altitude changes from filtered data<br>
- Calculate power from flat and vertical climbing<br>
- Log all necessary data points to verify functionality.<br>

Definition of Done: Cadence and altitude pass the DoD as outlined in BACKLOG.md and are<br> partially or fully calculating total_power<br>
accurately as outlined in BACKLOG.md with all functionalities working individually and together.<br> 

## Sprint 2
Commited: S3 and S4<br>
User Story S3: As a runner, I want total_power calculated from flat and hill running (after the fact for now)<br>
User Story S4: As a runner, I want an LED gradient to show my exerted effort.<br>
Tasks:<br>
- Find all necessary components I need to order, and order those.<br>
- Write additional code to translate power to colors<br>
- Connect wirelessly output of microp to LED (somewhere where the LED is easily visible, e.g wrist)<br>
- Log all necessary data points to verify functionality. <br>
Definition of Done: Cadence and altitude are used to calculate total_power accurately as defined in BACKLOG.md and LED is working as outlined in BACKLOG.md.
