# Daily logs

2025-08-12
yesterday: repo set up; learned basic commands of git; learned principles of Agile
today: finish setting up entire repo (backlog.md, log.md); set up backlog.md in such a way
that the project is for the most part understandable, and what I must do next is relatively clear
with the exception of things I may learn while going through the project, in which case I will
add them.
